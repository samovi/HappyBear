# HappyBear
Here is a tribute to my mutt.
<p>You were happy to see us, then you were Bear.</p>
<p>But we saw you differently, we didn't care.</p>
<p>You were happy to walk, and to catch, and to play.</p>
<p>I could have stayed at the shelter all day!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We came again, you were Happy again.</p>
<p>But we found out you were leaving us then.</p>
<p>Adopted, said the manager of the pound.</p>
<p>So with tears in our eyes we just played around.</p>
